# makeMagicSquare(n)
# Write the function makeMagicSquare(n) that takes a positive 
# odd integer n and returns an nxn magic square by following 
# the resource here. If n is not a positive odd integer, 
# return None.

# URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_square

# Hints: From Geeks for Geeks.
# Did you find any pattern in which the numbers are stored? 

# In any magic square, the first number i.e. 1 is 
# stored at position (n/2, n-1). Let this position 
# be (i,j). The next number is stored at position (i-1, j+1) 
# where we can consider each row & column as circular array 
# i.e. they wrap around.

# Three conditions hold:

# 1. The position of next number is calculated by 
# decrementing row number of the previous number by 1,
#  and incrementing the column number of the previous 
# number by 1. At any time, if the calculated row position 
# becomes -1, it will wrap around to n-1. Similarly, if 
# the calculated column position becomes n, it will wrap 
# around to 0.

# 2. If the magic square already contains a number at the 
# calculated position, calculated column position will be 
# decremented by 2, and calculated row position will be 
# incremented by 1.

# 3. If the calculated row position is -1 & calculated 
# column position is n, the new position would be: (0, n-2).
